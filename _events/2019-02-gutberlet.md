        Accelerator driven neutron sources with high brilliance neutron provision present an alternative to classical neutron sources of fission reactors and spallation sources to provide scientist with neutrons to probe structure and dynamics of matter. 

        The Jülich Centre for Neutron Science has started a project to develop, design and demonstrate compact accelerator driven high-brilliance neutron sources (HBS) as an efficient and cost effective alternative to current low- and medium-flux reactor and spallation sources. The HBS will consist of a high current proton accelerator, a compact neutron production and moderator unit and an optimized neutron transport system to provide thermal and cold neutrons with high brilliance. The project offers construction of a scalable neutron source ranging from university based neutron laboratory to full user facility with open access and service. Embedded within international collaboration with partners from Germany, Europe and Japan the Jülich HBS project will offer flexible solutions to the scientific.

        We will describe the currents status of the project, the next steps, milestones and the vision for the future neutron landscape in Europe.

        There will be place for short "lightning" talks. 
        You can also have one, see [neutron.beer#info-for-speakers](/#info-for-speakers).

After the summer break we are going to meetup again. We will discuss about small neutron sources. Talks will start at 18:00 sharp so don't be late. The whole basement will be dedicated to our session from 18:00 - 19:00 in order to not be disturbed. 
First will be the talk of Thomas Gutberlet followed with few short "lightning talks" (up to 5 minutes).
