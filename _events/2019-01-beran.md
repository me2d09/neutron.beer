        The first neutron beer should be of course about the future BEER instrument
        at the European Spallation Source ESS. You will learn how to use neutrons in
        material science adapted for engineering, how to build a neutron instrument and
        about life in Sweden.

This will be the first meetup of the Czech neutron community. And the first neutron beer should be of the course about future BEER instrument at ESS. The meeting will start with the talk of Přemysl Beran and afterwards there will be time for short "lightning talks" (up to 5 minutes) followed by the opened discussion and networking.
