The idea on neutron beer is to strengthen Czech neutron community. We plan to organize semi-formal seminar from the Neutron world, connected with socializing and networking. The meetup is opened to public (however scientists interested in neutrons are natural attendees). There will be always one general/popular talk about neutron techniques/neutron sources/neutron instruments and then slot for short talks and discussion.
